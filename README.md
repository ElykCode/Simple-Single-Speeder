# Simple-Single-Speeder
A quick script to calculate various aspects of a single speed bike

Kind of also an experiment with Python classes, just messing around and having fun.

## Features
* Calculates speed at a given RPM and the gear ratio for a given wheel size and gearing setup

## TODO
* Implement JSON parsing - wouldn't it be cool to be able to put each bike in a JSON file and have the program read each one?
